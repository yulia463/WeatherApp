# 🌦 WeatherApp

Interactive Android application for viewing the current weather and a multi-day forecast.
**Author:** Yulia Slatvitskaya

📎 **GitHub:** [https://github.com/yulia463/WeatherApp](https://github.com/yulia463)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies

- **Kotlin**
- **Retrofit + GsonConverterFactory** – HTTP networking
- **Coroutines (lifecycleScope)** – asynchronous background operations
- **WeatherAPI.com** – data source
- **Android View API** – programmatic UI layout
- **Dynamic Layouts (LinearLayout, FrameLayout, ScrollView)**

---

## 🚀 Features

- Fetches weather data by coordinates (default: Moscow)
- Displays:
  - Current temperature and condition
  - Hourly forecast
  - 3-day forecast with collapsible cards
- Centered blue loading indicator (custom color matching the app theme)
- Error dialog with a retry option when data fails to load

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. When launched, a **centered blue loading spinner** is displayed.
2. The app requests weather data using `RetrofitClient`.
3. Once data is received:
   - Current weather information is shown
   - Hourly forecast appears in a horizontal scroll view
   - 3-day forecast is displayed in collapsible cards
4. If an error occurs, a dialog appears allowing the user to retry.
